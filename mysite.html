      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p>My name is Alexis Bondy. I am a recent graduate of Hunter College - CUNY where I earned a double Bachelor of Arts in Art History and English Literature - Creative Writing. I spend the six months after graduation on a research study at
        Trinity College Dublin. Now, I am back in the States, ready to take all that I have learned and apply them to my new career. </p>

        <h3>Research and Workshopping</h3>
        <p>Throughout college, I took many workshopping and research courses where the focus was to not only collaboratively edit pieces, but also collect research on selected topics, compile them, then present ideas with the class. While at times
          tedious, the courses have made me adept at working towards a shared goal despite complex group dynamics. Since graduation, I have been taking courses to deepen my understanding of data and analytics in addition to learning computer
          programming languages.</p>
